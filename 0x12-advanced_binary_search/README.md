# 0x11. Heap Sort

## Requirements

* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `sort.h`
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Tasks

**0. Advanced Binary Search**

You may have noticed that basic binary search does not necessarily return the index of the first value in the array (if this value appears more than once in the array). In this exercise, you’ll have to solve this problem.

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.
