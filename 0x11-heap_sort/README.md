# 0x11. Heap Sort

## heap sort

* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `sort.h`
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Tasks
**0. Heap sort**

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the `sift-down` heap sort algorithm
* You’re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
